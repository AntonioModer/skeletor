# skeletor

## About

Skeletor is a 2d skeleton animation system for [LÃ–VE 2D](https://love2d.org/).

## Loading the module

To load the module, use the following code.

    local Skeletor = require('skeletor')
    skeletor = Skeletor()

## Default style

This is the default style used to control the behavior and drawing of skeleton elements:

    show = true -- show the element (use false to hide skeletons or bones)  

    boundariesCalculate = false -- calculate the skeleton's boundary (useful for collision detection)  
    boundariesShow = false -- show the boundary (useful for testing)  
    boundariesStyle = "smooth" -- the style of the boundary line ("smooth", "rough")  
    boundariesWidth = 1 -- the width of the boundary line  
    boundariesColor = {255, 255, 255} -- the color of the boundary line  

    wireShow = true -- show the wireframe  
    wireStyle = "smooth" - the style of the wireframe line ("smooth", "rough")  
    wireWidth = 1 -- the width of the wireframe line  
    wireColor = {255, 255, 255} - the color of the wireframe line  

    jointShow = true -- show joints  
    jointMode = "fill" -- the drawing mode for joints  
    jointShape = skeletor:getEllipseVertices(0, 0, 8, 8, math.rad(0), 30) -- The shape of joints  
    jointRotatable = false -- rotate joints when skeletons or bones are scaled  
    jointScalable = true -- scale joints when skeletons or bones are scaled  
    jointColor = {255, 0, 0} -- the color of joints  

    shapeShow = false -- show shapes  
    shapeMode = "line" -- drawing mode for shapes  
    shapeShape = skeletor:getEllipseVertices(0, 0, 1, .35, 0, 30) -- the shape for shapes  
    shapeSx = 1 -- x scale factor for shapes  
    shapeSy = 1 -- y scale factor for shapes  
    shapeColor = {0, 255, 0} - the color of shapes
